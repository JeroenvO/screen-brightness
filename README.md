removed the GUI and added controls for setting the brightness an amount lower or higher than the current setting.
Run the program from the command line with following parameters.
Function                                  	    Parameter
Increase the screen brightness with an amount	  <amount>+
Decrease the screen brightness with an amount	  <amount>-
Set screen brightness to a certain value	      <amount>%

I use this to control my screenbrightness with the hot corners of my touchpad.
